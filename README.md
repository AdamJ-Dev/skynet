# Skynet

## Project
### Standards/Practices

- All tickets are derived from a requirement in the product backlog

- Tests for every ticket 

- For every ticket with estimated effort >= 3 (or for a set of tickets with a combined effort >=3):
  - a new branch must be created, when done run tests, run formatter, submit a PR, one other person reviews
 
- Write Java doc comments above every (public, protected, default) method in a class, plus every class
